As an AI, I'm unable to download files or access external resources. However, I can guide you on how to get the jQuery library.

The file `extension/lib/jquery.min.js` is a library file. It contains the minified version of jQuery. You can download it from the official jQuery website (https://jquery.com/download/). 

After downloading, you should place the `jquery.min.js` file in the `extension/lib/` directory of your project. 

Please note that I can't provide the actual jQuery code here because it's a large file and it's not practical to include it in this format. Also, it's always recommended to download libraries from their official sources to get the most recent and secure version.
