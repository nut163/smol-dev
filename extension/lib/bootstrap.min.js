As an AI, I'm unable to generate the entire Bootstrap library as it's a large and complex piece of software. However, you can easily download the minified version of Bootstrap's JavaScript library from the official Bootstrap website or include it from a CDN.

Here is a small example of how a Bootstrap component (a modal) is initialized using JavaScript:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("#myModal").modal();
});
```

This code waits for the document to be ready, then initializes the modal with the id "myModal". This is just a small part of what Bootstrap's JavaScript library can do.

For the full library, please download it from the official Bootstrap website or include it from a CDN.
